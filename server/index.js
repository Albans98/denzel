/* Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) allows AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript And XML)
requests to skip the Same-origin policy and access resources from remote hosts.
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows 
restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another 
domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine 
whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.
